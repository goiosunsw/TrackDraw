TrackDraw
=========
TrackDraw is a speech analysis and synthesis tool designed for speech science novices and experts alike.

History
=======
The original TrackDraw was a MATLAB package designed by Peter Assmann, Will Ballard, Laurie Bornstein, and Dwayne Paschall. This package allowed the user to draw tracks on a graphical user interface which served as the input for time-varying formant resonators in a Klatt synthesizer. It also supported drawing tracks over the spectrogram of an input speech waveform and sine-wave synthesis. More information about the original TrackDraw can be found here: http://www.utdallas.edu/~assmann/TRACKDRAW/about.html

In the summer of 2016, efforts began to modernize the original TrackDraw and expand on its features. This code represents the first complete alpha build of the modernized TrackDraw in Python 3.

Purpose
=======
TrackDraw is a speech analysis and synthesis tool, with a strong pedagogical focus. Features include:
	- Plot of the spectrogram of an input speech waveform or synthesized speech waveform
	- Variable display parameters and settings for the spectrogram plot, including window length and type
	-
